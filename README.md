# PreciselyAPISJavaSDK

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to be installed.

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn deploy
```

Refer to the [official documentation](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/usage.html) for more information.

### Maven users ([Java SDK Maven Repo Reference](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.precisely.apis/PreciselyAPISJavaSDK))

Add this dependency to your project's POM:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.precisely.apis</groupId>
    <artifactId>PreciselyAPISJavaSDK</artifactId>
    <version>18.1.0</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle users

Add this dependency to your project's build file:

```groovy
 implementation "com.precisely.apis:PreciselyAPISJavaSDK:18.1.0"
```

### Others

At first generate the JAR by executing:

    mvn package

Then manually install the following JARs:

* target/PreciselyAPISJavaSDK-18.1.0.jar
* target/lib/*.jar

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Java code:

```java

import com.precisely.ApiException;
import com.precisely.apis.model.AddressesResponse;
import com.precisely.apis.AddressesServiceApi;

public class AddressesServiceApiExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AddressesServiceApi api = new AddressesServiceApi();
        try {
            api.getApiClient().generateAndSetAccessToken("PUT_YOUR_KEY_HERE","PUT_YOUR_SECRET_HERE");

            String country = "USA";
            String areaName1 = null;
            String areaName2 = null;
            String areaName3 = null;
            String areaName4 = null;
            String postCode = "90001";
            String maxCandidates = "3";
            String page = "1";

            AddressesResponse response = api.getAddressesbyBoundaryName(country, areaName1, areaName2, areaName3, areaName4, postCode, maxCandidates, page);
			System.out.println(response);

        } catch (ApiException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

    }
}

```
